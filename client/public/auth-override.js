/**
 * This file has been intentionally emptied as part of the Authentication System cleanup.
 * The fallback authentication system has been removed in favor of using Auth0 exclusively.
 * All authentication is now handled through the official Auth0 SDK.
 * See AuthCore.tsx for the current implementation.
 *
 * DO NOT RESTORE THIS FILE - It contained a less secure authentication fallback system
 * that is no longer needed with the improved Auth0 integration.
