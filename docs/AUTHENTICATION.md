# Velo-Altitude Authentication System Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Velo-Altitude authentication system provides a secure, reliable authentication mechanism based on Auth0. This document describes the authentication flow, component structure, security considerations, and testing approach.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login Initiation**:
   - User clicks "Login" button in the application
   - Application calls `login()` method from Auth context
   - Auth0's loginWithRedirect() is triggered, redirecting to Auth0's hosted login page

2. **Auth0 Authentication**:
   - User completes authentication on Auth0's secure login page
   - Auth0 redirects back to the application with an authorization code
   - Auth0 SDK exchanges the code for tokens (ID token, access token)
   - Tokens are securely stored in memory by Auth0 SDK (not localStorage)

3. **Protected Route Access**:
   - `ProtectedRoute` component checks authentication status via `useAuth()`
   - If authenticated, content is displayed
   - If not authenticated, user is redirected to login

4. **Token Management**:
   - Access tokens are automatically added to API requests by interceptor
   - Token expiration is handled by Auth0 SDK
   - Token refresh happens automatically when needed

5. **Logout**:
   - User clicks "Logout" button
   - Application calls `logout()` method
   - Auth0 SDK clears tokens and redirects to Auth0 logout endpoint
   - User is redirected back to the application's home page

## Component Structure

### Core Authentication Components

1. **AuthCore.tsx**:
   - Central authentication logic
   - Manages Auth0 integration
   - Provides context for authentication state
   - Exposes token management methods

2. **ProtectedRoute.tsx**:
   - Higher-order component for securing routes
   - Redirects unauthenticated users
   - Shows loading state while checking authentication

3. **authUtils.ts**:
   - Utility functions for authentication
   - Token acquisition and caching
   - User information retrieval

### API Integration Components

1. **apiConfig.ts**:
   - Configures Axios instance for API requests
   - Adds authorization headers to requests
   - Handles token refresh on 401 errors
   - Manages request retries after token refresh

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**:
   - No sensitive authentication data stored in localStorage
   - Auth0 SDK manages tokens securely in memory
   - Token refresh handled securely through Auth0

2. **Protected Routes**:
   - Client-side protection using ProtectedRoute component
   - Server-side verification of tokens for all API requests
   - Role-based access control implemented where needed

3. **Token Validation**:
   - Tokens validated on every request
   - Expiration handled properly
   - Signature verification on server-side

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Proper error management for authentication failures
   - Graceful degradation on network issues
   - Clear user feedback for authentication problems

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Testing authentication utility functions
   - Testing protected routes behavior
   - Token handling and API interceptor tests

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Testing authentication flow with Auth0
   - Testing protected feature access
   - Testing token refresh scenarios

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Full login/logout flow testing
   - Protected page access testing
   - Error scenario testing

## Environment Variables

The authentication system relies on the following environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL - Auth0 domain
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID - Auth0 client ID
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE - API audience for tokens
REACT_APP_AUTH0_SCOPE - Token scope (default: 'openid profile email')
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Token Storage**: Auth0 SPA SDK stores tokens in memory, which means tokens are lost on page refresh. This is mitigated by Auth0's silent authentication feature.

2. **Role Management**: User roles are currently determined by email patterns (admin vs user). A more robust role management system could be implemented in the future.

3. **Background Token Refresh**: In some cases, token refresh may cause a brief interruption in user experience. This can be further optimized.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Role-Based Access Control**: Implement more granular permissions system.

2. **User Profile Management**: Add more comprehensive user profile editing capabilities.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable and configure MFA options via Auth0.

4. **SSO Integration**: Support for additional SSO providers through Auth0.

5. **Offline Support**: Implement better offline support with secure token persistence.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Fails to Complete**:
   - Check Auth0 configuration variables
   - Verify redirect URIs are properly configured in Auth0 dashboard
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Token Refresh Issues**:
   - Verify Auth0 client is properly configured
   - Check that audience and scope are correctly set
   - Ensure token expiration is being properly handled

3. **Protected Routes Not Working**:
   - Ensure route is wrapped with ProtectedRoute component
   - Check authentication status in React DevTools
   - Verify API calls include proper authorization headers
