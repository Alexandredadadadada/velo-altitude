# Grand Est Cyclisme Website - Handover Document

## Project Overview
The Grand Est Cyclisme website is a comprehensive platform for cyclists in the Grand Est region and beyond, offering features such as:
- Col exploration with detailed information on European mountain passes
- Advanced training modules with FTP calculation and workout planning
- Nutrition planning and recommendations
- Social features for cyclists to connect and share experiences
- Multilingual support (French, English, German, Italian, Spanish)

## Current Project Status

### Completed Modules
- **Base Structure**: The overall project structure is in place
- **European Cols Data**: Integrated in `server/data/`
- **Translations**: Translation files (fr, en, de, it, es) integrated in `i18n/`

### Partially Implemented Modules
- **Col Explorer**: `EnhancedColDetail` component implemented with advanced features (weather, reviews, maps, detailed statistics)
- **Social Features**: `EnhancedSocialHub` component implemented
- **Common Components**: All common components integrated (AnimatedTransition, ParallaxHeader, InteractiveCard, EnhancedNavigation, VisualEffectsProvider)

### Modules Requiring Completion
- **Nutrition**: The `NutritionPlanner` component exists but needs additional functionality:
  - Calorie calculation based on user profile
  - Implementation of the four nutritional models
  - Meal planning for pre/during/post-training
- **Training**: Components such as `TrainingPlanBuilder`, `FTPCalculator`, `HIITBuilder`, and `EndurancePrograms` exist but need to be completed:
  - Implementation of 6 different training zone calculation methods
  - Complete workout library
  - Performance analysis

## Build Issues

### Resolved Issues
- Missing files: Created necessary files for build (index.html, setupTests.js, etc.)
- Missing dependencies: Required packages installed (react-router-dom, react-i18next, etc.)
- Issues with weather-map.js: Created a compatible version and placed it in the correct directory

### Outstanding Issues
- **CSS Errors**: Several CSS files generate errors during build, particularly with image references and CSS variables
- **Missing Image References**: Code references images that don't exist in the project
- **Webpack Configuration**: Additional adjustments needed to resolve remaining errors

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Resolve build errors**:
   - Create missing CSS files
   - Add missing images or update references
   - Fix webpack configuration issues

2. **Complete the Nutrition module**:
   - Implement calorie calculation functionality
   - Create the meal planning interface
   - Integrate the nutritional database

3. **Enhance the Training module**:
   - Complete the FTP calculator with all 6 calculation methods
   - Finish the training plan builder
   - Implement the workout library

4. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test all functionality across browsers
   - Ensure responsive design on all devices
   - Optimize performance

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, i18next
- **Styling**: CSS modules
- **Bundling**: Webpack
- **Optimization**: Custom performance and image optimizers
- **Maps/Visualization**: Leaflet, Three.js, Mapbox

## Development Environment Setup
1. Install Node.js (v18+) and npm
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. For building the production version, use `npm run build`

## Known Issues and Solutions
- For the weather-map.js issue: A simplified version using IIFE has been created
- For CSS errors: Review all CSS files and ensure image paths are correct
- For missing images: Create placeholder SVGs or update references
